## Getting Started

SQLTools is a set of VS Code extensions that connect to, query, and display results from a SQL database manager.
(Supported databases are listed below.)

The installation process is straightforward: 

* Open VS Code
* Click the Extensions view (in the left bar), then search for `@tag:sqltools-driver`.
This lists all the drivers available for SQLTools.
* Install the driver for your database. This also installs the core SQLTools extension.
* Click the SQLTools icon (in the left bar)
* Create a _connection_ to your database. To do this, hover over **CONNECTIONS** in the SQLTools pane. Click the "Add New Connection" icon and choose the driver and enter the connection parameters.

You can then open and query it from within VS Code.
