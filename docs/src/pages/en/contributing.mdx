## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change under GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/issues) and start writing code. Use the information about [building](contributing/building) and [testing](contributing/testing).

- Send a PR when finished. Remember to check if your PR fixes another existing issue as well as the one you opened.

Thanks!
