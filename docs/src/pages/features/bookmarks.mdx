# Bookmarks

Whenever you have some SQL text selected you have three ways to bookmark it. Run `Bookmark Selected Query` from the Command Palette; click the `+` button on the header of the Bookmarks section of the SQLTools view; or use the selection's context menu.
You can also assign a keybinding to this action. Its command id is `sqltools.bookmarkSelection`.

## Using the Command Palette

1. With an open file, select the queries you want to bookmark.
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+p` or `F1`, search by `SQLTools Bookmarks: Bookmark Selected Query`.
3. Hit `Enter`.

## Bookmarks Explorer

Just click the `+` button alongside the Bookmarks header in the SQLTools view.
