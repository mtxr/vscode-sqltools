# Building the project

> Still work in progress

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [node v14](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. If you need to switch between node versions, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Building

1. In your terminal, go to the project root.

```shell
cd vscode-sqltools
yarn # will install all dependencies and run some scripts
yarn run start # or yarn run dev:watch
```

2. Open the project workspace (`project.code-workspace`) on VSCode.

3. Go to the Debug panel and run `Launch Extension and LS` to start debugging both extension and language server.

4. Add your breakpoints and start hacking!

### Troubleshooting

#### Installing on macOS m1

On the root of the project, run `CXXFLAGS="--std=c++17" yarn` if you are on node 16+ and experience errors.
