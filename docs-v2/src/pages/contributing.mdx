- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage&template=bug_report.md&title=). Choose and follow the issue template to include as much relevant information as possible and/or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch [here](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/compare).

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change under GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/issues) and start writing code. Send a PR when finished. Remember to check if your PR fixes another existing issue.
